# Einsendeaufgabe-4
Warehouse administration. Assignment for my informatics course
####WARNING!####
The code is written in English but since it is an assignment for an german course for studying informatics, all 
the descriptions and comments are in GERMAN.

The full assignment description is also in the source file (top comment block, 
also in german). Another student wanted to see how I solved it, that's why I uploaded it.

The idea is, to get familiar with stuctures and arrays. I had to build a program which could be used to administrate a warehouse, i.e. 
add boxes and save their size, display a selected box, edit a box, delete a box and display all boxes in the system.
That's the assignment, but I wanted to build up something, that could be really used by someone and not just showing that I understood
the concepts. Therefore I added methods that use exception handling to prevent input errors and I tried to keep it structured and simple.

If you have ideas on how to improve this system please don't hesitate. I already handed it in. So now we can experiment just for the sake
of learning.
And if you find this too trivial, then I agree: It's just a simple, yet funny way of learning C#.

Thanks for reading and have a good time :)
